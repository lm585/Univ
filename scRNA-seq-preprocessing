Step 1:
You had fastq files for each scRNA library. To generate single cell feature (gene) counts for a single library, run cellranger count. You can set the parameter --expect-cells=10000 and the option â€“nosecondary when running the count command.

Run cellranger count for each library. If you have 10 libraries, you need to run 10 times with 10 outputs. Often, one sample (or one donor) is one library.

Please note that, by default, --include-introns option is turned off, meaning that intronic reads were excluded from the UMI counting.

Step 2:
Step1 will generate filtered_feature_bc_matrix directory, among other outputs, for each library. Then use an R package Seurat. The following web site gives a nice documentation to merge multiple library outputs from cellranger into a single Seurat object.

With the single Seurat object generated, you can continue the downstream traditional analysis with scRNA-seq data.
